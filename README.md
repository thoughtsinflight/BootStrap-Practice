# Boot Strap Project
    The purpose of this project is to recreate a previously made webpages with boot strap and to practice responsiveness
# Motivation
    The main motivation behind this project was to understand responsiveness. In the previous project, responsiveness wasn't even an after thought. But now I understand its purpose, importance and appreciate the difficulty.
# What I Learned
    The biggest error I made was assuming that I would have to search for bootstrap elements to plug into my webpages and then try to modify them to fix the images handed to us. It took much to long for me to relize that bootstrap wasn't really a collection of elements to copy and paste, but a set of classes with its own CSS that you can assign to element in your html.
# Conclusion
    I really struggled with this project at first, but when I made the breakthrough, putting together the pages was pretty easy and the innate responsiveness of bootstrap classes worked near flawlessly.
